# Exploratory Data Analysis-Terrorism

## Overview

Welcome to the "Exploring Global Terrorism Data" project! This repository showcases my exploration of a terrorism dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The project was completed as part of my internship at CodersCave.

## Project Description

In this project, I dived into the fascinating world of terrorism data, seeking to uncover insights hidden within the numbers. The primary goal was to understand trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset by applying EDA techniques.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Highlights

- Loaded and inspected the terrorism dataset using Pandas.
- Calculated summary statistics to gain initial insights into the data.
- Explored data types, null values, and general dataset structure using `df.info()`.
- Investigated categorical columns like 'country', 'region', and 'attack type' by identifying unique values and trends.
- Created a variety of visualizations, including count plots, histograms, and a heatmap to visualize correlations.
- Explored the distribution of attacks by year, attack types, regions, months, and success rates.
- Highlighted targeted industries most affected by terrorism through a bar plot.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the terrorism dataset file.
- `main/`: Jupyter Notebook files documenting the EDA process.
- `README.md`: The detailed project README you're currently reading.


## Conclusion

Exploring this dataset was an enlightening experience, showcasing the power of data analysis in uncovering valuable insights. This project marks the beginning of a journey into understanding the complex landscape of global terrorism through data-driven exploration.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and adapt the analysis techniques to other datasets of interest. Let's continue our journey of discovery through data!
